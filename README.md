# Introduction

This is a farm version of Tower Defence game with chickens, pigs, cows, wolves and horses as enemies. The game has five levels and each
level has ten enemies. One has to kill the enemies in order to pass the level. The player gets five lives in the beginning, and each 
enemy that survives through the path, decreases the lives by one. Winning means that all the five levels have been passed 
successfully. The game is lost when there are no more lives left.

During each level the player can build towers and obstacles that kill or cause damage to the enemies. Towers and obstacles can be 
bought with money that is gained when the enemies die. One can also get money by selling the already built towers. The towers (their 
range, damaging effect and speed) can also be upgraded with money. The towers have cooldowns that restrict the frequency in which they 
shoot.

There is also a point system for evaluating how well the player has played, with a maximum of 5750 points. Points are gained when an 
enemy is killed.
